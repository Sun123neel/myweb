what is performance testing?
performance testing is non functional testing is the process to evaluate or calculate performance of the applicatons. 
As performance tester is calculating the speed,stability and scalability of the applicatons.
 speed :check whether applicatons is responding quiclkly or not.
 stability:it determines the whether applications is accepting derived load or not
             or it is accpting the giving load or not 
 scalability: what is the maximum load app is accepting.

why performance testing is required?
A:To avoid the business loss we need to be pt.

Think time: time delay between action to action is called think time
Pacing time:time delay between iteration to iteration ia called pacing time.
